### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...

[Grams converter](https://github.com/jamesliudotcc/grams_converter), [deployed](https://jamesliudotcc.github.io/grams_converter/). I use this every week.
[Time tracker](https://github.com/jamesliudotcc/lawyer-timer). It was deployed.
[Fox and Geese](https://github.com/jamesliudotcc/fox-and-geese). [Deployed](https://jamesliudotcc.github.io/fox-and-geese/). My first project from bootcamp. Uh, the visual bug on the grid is new.
